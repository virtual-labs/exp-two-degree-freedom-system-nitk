        "a": "Correct, the right answer is (a). Resonance indeed occurs under harmonic excitation. When a system is subjected to an external force with a frequency close to its natural frequency (or one of its natural frequencies), it can experience significant vibration amplitudes. This phenomenon is known as resonance.",
